# üöÄ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **personal repository** where I document my journey of learning and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
This repo contains **logic implementations** (not full compilable programs) in **C++**, focusing purely on the **core problem-solving approach**.

---

## üìå Purpose of This Repo
- To **showcase my problem-solving skills** in DSA.  
- To build a structured collection of **logic snippets** for common and advanced problems.  
- To track my **growth in algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming**.  
- To serve as a **quick reference** for revising key concepts.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Read the Code
- Each file contains only the **logic snippet** (not a full program).  
- To run, wrap the snippet inside `main()` and add required headers.  

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Logic snippet from repo
int findMax(int arr[], int n) {
    int maxVal = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > maxVal) {
            maxVal = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return maxVal;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 5, 30};
    int n = 4;
    cout << "Maximum element: " << findMax(arr, n);
    return 0;
}
```

# üåü Skills Highlighted

- Problem-solving using **C++**
